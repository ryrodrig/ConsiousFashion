### How is it all made

1. "Z" starts with sourcing eco-friendly materials, such as organic cotton, recycled polyester, and plant-based fibers like bamboo and hemp.

2. Next, "Z" focuses on ethical production, ensuring that all workers involved in the manufacturing process are treated fairly and paid a living wage.

3. The final step in the "Z" pattern is minimizing the environmental impact of the clothing. This can be achieved through energy-efficient production methods, reducing waste, and using natural dyes and finishes.
